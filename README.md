Interactex
==========

Interactex is an environment to create smart textile applications that interact with a smartphone.

# Overview

 Figure below shows Interactex's high-level design and workflow. 

![alt tag](Documentation/images/Interactex/overview.png)

Interactex Designer is used to create the application and circuit design visually. Interactex Client executes applications and communicates with the smart textile. Interactex Client runs on a smartphone. Interactex Firmware runs on a microcontroller attached to the smart textile and executes commands received from Interactex Client. TextIT is used to create and export functionality components that can be imported into Interactex Designer.

## Interactex Designer

Interactex Designer runs on an iPad device and is available in the AppStore: 

https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/interactex-designer/id973912620?mt=8

The image below describes the main components of the user interface.

Applications created in Interactex Designer are transferred wirelessly to Interactex Client. Interactex has three main modes: Circuit Layout, Visual Programming and Simulation Modes.

### Circuit Layout Mode

In Circuit Layout Mode, users lay out the hardware devices on the smart textile and draw their circuits.

### Visual Programming Mode

In Visual Programming Mode, a palette with reusable objects is made available.

Interactex follows a flow-based programming paradigm. Events of an object are coupled to functions of another object.

A new visual programming interface that will display object's events, methods and properties and their couplings is under development. A screenshot of the new visual programming interface is shown below:

### Simulation Mode

In Simulation Mode, applications are simulated and display runtime information for debugging purposes. Sensor data is simulated by users by performing multitouch gestures on sensors' visual representations. The states of output devices is represented visually with animations, sounds and images.

The screenshot below shows how different objects are represented in Simulation Mode.

## Comparison Operators

Comparison Operators emit the conditionIsTrue() event if the fist input variable is bigger (or smaller, equal, etc.) than the second input variable and otherwise emit the conditionIsFalse() event. Comparison Operators emit the alternative conditionChanged() event.

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic Operators emit the computed(Number) event with the result of the operation.

## Variables

Variables have an event to set the value to be stored in the Variable and emit the valueChanged() event when the value changes its value. The value stored in a Variables can also be accessed through the 'value' property.
